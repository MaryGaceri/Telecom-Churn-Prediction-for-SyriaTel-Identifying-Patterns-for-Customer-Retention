# Business Understanding

# Introduction
This project centers on SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications company, seeking to predict and reduce customer churn. Customer churn, defined as customers discontinuing services, poses a significant challenge to businesses. Our focus is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to unveil patterns indicative of potential customer exits. By identifying these patterns, SyriaTel can proactively implement measures to retain customers and mitigate revenue loss. The project involves thorough data analysis, the development of predictive models, and the formulation of actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies. The overarching goal is to augment SyriaTel's understanding of customer behaviors, ultimately contributing to more effective retention initiatives.

## Problem Statement

This project emphasizes the importance of pinpointing the key factors affecting house prices. Traditional methods rely on unreliable evidence, hindering our ability to predict and understand price changes accurately. To address this, we promote the extensive use of multiple regression models for analyzing housing sales data. These models help us uncover the relationships between different factors and house prices, considering the impact of multiple variables together.

## Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop and implement an effective churn prediction system for SyriaTel, the telecommunications company, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to empower SyriaTel with the ability to forecast and mitigate customer churn, ultimately enhancing customer retention and minimizing revenue loss.

## General Objective

1.Develop accurate machine learning models for predicting customer churn based on historical data.

2.Identify and analyze patterns and trends in customer behavior that contribute to churn.

3.Conduct thorough data analysis, addressing missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables for model input.

4.Create relevant features through feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of churn models.

5.Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal predictive accuracy.

6.Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on churn predictions to aid SyriaTel in implementing effective customer retention strategies.

7.Improve SyriaTel's understanding of customer behaviors contributing to churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.

8.Assess the potential financial impact of reducing churn and increasing customer retention rates for SyriaTel.


## Data Understanding

In the data understanding phase, a thorough examination of the Telecom Churn dataset was conducted, focusing on customer-related features and the target variable, churn. Key activities included identifying data types, addressing missing values, and generating descriptive statistics for numeric variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided valuable visual insights, especially in understanding data distributions and relationships. Categorical variables were examined for potential one-hot encoding, and target variable exploration shed light on the distribution of churn instances. Correlation analysis contributed to identifying potential multicollinearity. Integration of domain knowledge enhanced the understanding of variable significance. The comprehensive assessment of data quality laid a solid foundation for subsequent data preprocessing and model development stages.


## Results and Interpretation

## Baseline Model:
In the Logistic Regression model, the overall accuracy stands at 85%, indicating a reasonably good performance. However, a closer look at the classification report reveals a challenge in correctly identifying the minority class (1), with low precision, recall, and F1-score. Specifically, for the positive class, precision is 67%, recall is 4%, and the F1-score is 7%. The confusion matrix illustrates that out of the 101 actual instances of churn, only 4 were correctly predicted, while 97 were falsely classified. On the positive side, the model performs well in predicting non-churn instances (0), achieving high precision, recall, and F1-score. This suggests the model's struggle in capturing patterns associated with customers who churn, highlighting an area for improvement in future model iterations or the exploration of more complex models.


## More complex model
In the Random Forest model, there is a notable improvement in accuracy, reaching 94%. The classification report reveals strong performance in predicting both non-churn (0) and churn (1) instances. For the non-churn class, precision, recall, and F1-score are high (93%, 100%, and 96% respectively), indicating robust model performance. The model shows effectiveness in identifying customers who do not churn. However, for churn instances, precision remains high at 97%, but recall is lower at 59%, leading to a slightly lower F1-score of 74%. The confusion matrix illustrates that out of the 101 actual instances of churn, 60 were correctly predicted, while 41 were falsely classified. This model outperforms the Logistic Regression model, particularly in its ability to identify customers who churn, demonstrating its suitability for the task.

## Hypertuned parameters
In the Tuned Random Forest model, hyperparameter optimization was performed, resulting in the following best hyperparameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}. The accuracy remains consistent at 94%, indicating that the model's general performance aligns with the previous Random Forest model. The classification report and confusion matrix exhibit similar results, with high precision, recall, and F1-score for the non-churn class (0) and slightly lower values for the churn class (1). The tuning process didn't lead to a significant improvement in model performance, suggesting that the default hyperparameters already capture the underlying patterns effectively. Further exploration of hyperparameter space or consideration of other complex models may be avenues for future enhancements.
